                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>The Plitvice lakes National Park belongs to Dinaric karst area and due to its specific geology, geomorphology and hydrology it truly is one of the most impressive karst entities in the world. Apart from dolomitic rock, mesosoic limestones with dolomite inserts are predominant here. The ratio between less porous or water-retaining dolomites and porous Jurassic limestone sediments in the karst has influenced the landscape of the overall area today. <a href="https://www.europeanbestdestinations.com/top/best-national-parks-in-europe/">(europeanbestdestinations)</a> <br><br></p>
                    <h2>Geography</h2>
                    <p> Plitvice Lakes National Park lies in the central part of the Dalmatia region of Croatia. In other words, the park is located in the hinterland of the Adriatic Sea. It is situated in the western part of the Balkan Peninsula and the mountains surrounding it are part of the Dinaric Alps.<a href="https://peakvisor.com/park/plitvice-lakes-national-park.html">(peakvisor)</a></p>

                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>The Triglav National Park (TNP) is the only Slovenian national park. The park was named after Triglav, the highest mountain in the heart of the park, which is also the highest summit in Slovenia (2864 m). The origin of the name Triglav is rather uncertain. Triglav (»three-headed«) owes its name to its characteristic shape as seen from the south-east side or to the highest Slavic deity who was supposed to have its throne on the top of the mountain. The mountain is a true national symbol and is featured on the national coat of arms and the flag. <a href=" https://www.europeanbestdestinations.com/top/best-national-parks-in-europe/">(europeanbestdestinations)</a><br><br> </p>
                    <h2>Geography</h2>
                    <p>Triglav National Park is located in the northwestern part of the country and is Slovenia's only national park. It covers an area of 340 square miles (880 sq km). Mount Triglav is located toward the center of the park and is the highest summit in the park as well as the collective Julian Alps. <a href="https://national-parks.org/slovenia/triglav">(national-parks)</a></p>

                    <h3>Take a Guided Tour Through the Park</h3>
                    <p>When entering a national park, you’ll receive a map from the park ranger that highlights all the major park attractions and viewpoints. It is recommended to use the provided park maps as a guide to tour around the national parks with a bus, RV, car, bicycle or even on foot. The map will specify roads that are motorized (by vehicle) versus non-motorized (on foot, horse etc.). Be aware that parking might be difficult in some national parks (like Zion National Park), so you might need to take a shuttle to access certain areas. We recommend taking a morning drive to get an idea of how you’d like to spend the rest of your time in the park.<a href="https://visitusaparks.com/10-best-things-to-do-when-visiting-a-national-park/">(visitusaparks)</a></p>

                    <h3>Set Up Camp</h3>
                    <p>For outdoor enthusiasts visiting a national park, camping is a must. Camping is the original overnight stay experience and in several national parks, it is the only way to stay the night. Many national park campgrounds require a reservation, but a few are first-come, first-serve. Be sure to do your research for campsite amenities and rules before your arrival. Camping isn’t just an affordable way to stay, it’s a must-do national park activity itself. Sleeping under the stars with fresh air surrounded by natural beauty makes camping a rite of passage when it come to visiting national parks. <a href="https://visitusaparks.com/10-best-things-to-do-when-visiting-a-national-park/">(visitusaparks)</a> </p>

                     <h2>Description</h2>
                     <p>The flora and fauna of Soomaa National Park are compelling. When travelling on the rivers it is often necessary to navigate past fallen aspen trunks – typically the work of floods and beavers. Other signs of beavers, such as chewed stumps and beaver lodges are often clearly visible along the riverbanks. Besides beavers, another little water loving creature is quite common here – the otter.<a href=" https://www.europeanbestdestinations.com/top/best-national-parks-in-europe/">(europeanbestdestinations)</a> <br><br></p>
                     <h2>Geography</h2>
                     <p>The national park, situated in Vahe-Eesti (aka Meso-Estonia), was created in 1993 to protect large raised bogs, flood plain grasslands, paludified forests, and meandering rivers. The territory of the national park is mostly covered with large mires, separated from each other by the rivers of the Pärnu River basin — the Navesti, Halliste, Raudna and Lemmjõgi rivers. Of the raised bogs, the most noteworthy is the Kuresoo Bog, whose steep southern slope, falling into Lemmejõgi, rises by 8 metres over a distance of 100 m.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soomaa_National_Park">(wikipedia)</a></p>

A series of easily accessible trails will lead you to natural wonders such as the waterfall known as the “Cola de Caballo” (horse’s tail) (where you’ll see the water drop from a height of over 1,700 metres), the Gradas de Soaso rapids, and to viewing points like the Garganta, set atop a cliff. You’ll be surrounded by mountains over 3,000 metres high, and you may be lucky enough to see bearded vultures –with wingspans of over 2 metres– as they soar above the summits.<a href=" https://www.europeanbestdestinations.com/top/best-national-parks-in-europe/">(europeanbestdestinations)</a><br></p>
                     <h2>Geography</h2>
                     <p>The national park was created to protect the high mountain topography of Monte Perdido and the Pyrenees. The region is dominated by limestone, with karst formations such as karren, sinkholes, and caves. The limestone originated from the Cretaceous and Eocene periods. Tectonic uplift has created deep canyons, and, during the Quaternary, repeated glaciations carved cirques and large U-shaped valleys.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordesa_y_Monte_Perdido_National_Park">(wikipedia)</a></p>

                     <h2>Description</h2>
                     <p>Goreme National Park and Cappadocia is a unique design of nature with slopes full of fairy-chimneys, rich water resources at the base of the valley, abundant flora, and numerous rock cut, frescoed churches.

 

                        Cappadocia, which was sculpted out of the tuff of the Erclyes and Hasan Mountains through millions of years by sand and water erosion, became the seat of several civilisations, and a silent witness to the cultural history of Anatolia. Cappadocia also covers underground cities. These enchanting and only partially revealed subterranean cities of Cappadocia are believed to have deeper levels awaiting exploration. The most extraordinary underground cities are in the regions of Kaymakli, Derinkuyu, Mazl Ozkonak and Tatlarin. The underground cities, for long periods used as sanctuaries, were recently renovated and made available to visitors. <a href=" https://www.europeanbestdestinations.com/top/best-national-parks-in-europe/">(europeanbestdestinations)</a><br><br> </p>
                     <h2>Geography</h2>
                     <p>The National Park is located in the volcanic region of Mount Hasan and Mount Erciyes in Central Anatolia, in the vicinity of Ürgüp, Çavuşin and Göreme. The park area consists of plateaus and high hills, dissected by streams and river valleys carved out by the water, the valleys having steeply sloping sides.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6reme_Historical_National_Park">(wikipedia)</a></p>

                     <h2>Description</h2>
                     <p>The high mountain area of Sarek looks a lot like the Alps with high mountain massifs and deep valleys. The most known is the Rapa valley with its magnificent delta and rich animal life. Some hundred glaciers form with the melted water, rapid mountain rivulets and small waterfalls. Six of the peaks are over 2000 meters over the ocean. Sarek is not easy accessible and have demanding terrain conditions. Except for the Royal Trail that passes in the southern parts, there are no hiking trails. <a href=" https://www.europeanbestdestinations.com/top/best-national-parks-in-europe/">(europeanbestdestinations)</a> <br><br> </p>
                     <h2>Geography</h2>
                     <p>Sarek National Park is situated in the Jokkmokk Municipality, Norrbotten County, Sweden, north of the Arctic Circle, 50 km (31.07 mi) from the Norwegian border.

                        The area of the park is 1,977 km2 (763 sq mi) and it is adjacent to the national parks Padjelanta (in the west) and Stora Sjöfallet (in the north). The parks have a combined area of approximately 5,500 km2 (2,100 sq mi).

                     <h2>Description</h2>
                     <p>Vatnajökull National Park (Icelandic: Vatnajökulsþjóðgarður) is one of three national parks in Iceland. It contains the entire Vatnajökull glacier and the extensive nearby areas, including the former Skaftafell National Park in the southwest and the former Jökulsárgljúfur National Park in the north.

                        What's special about the Vatnajökull National Park lies mainly in its great variety of scenic features, which are created through a combination of rivers, glaciers, volcanism and geothermal activity.<a href=" https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatnaj%C3%B6kull_National_Park">(wikipedia)</a><br><br> </p>
                     <h2>Geography</h2>
                     <p>The Vatnajökull has a surface area of 8,100 km² Europe's largest glacier. The average thickness of the ice is between 400 to 800 m, at the thickest point the ice is 950 m powerful. The glacier ice covers a multitude of mountains, valleys and plateaus. It even covers some active central volcanoes, of which Bárðarbunga is the largest and Grímsvötn the most active. The ice masses extend from over 2000 m above sea level up to 300 m below sea level. Nowhere else in Iceland, except on the Mýrdalsjökull glacier, does so much precipitation fall or so much water flow into the sea as on the south side of Vatnajökull. In fact, so much water is currently stored in Vatnajökull that Ölfusá, Iceland's river with the largest volume of water, would take over 200 years to transport this amount of water into the sea.<a href=" https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatnaj%C3%B6kull_National_Park">(wikipedia)</a></p>
