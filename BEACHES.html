                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>Bolonia beach, one of the most beautiful and wild beaches in Spain. Bolonia is more than a beach; it is a magnificent landscape full of almost virgin nature, fine white sand, crystal clear water and a very nice sea breeze. It is a very clean beach and its water is the most transparent in the area.<br><br></p>
                    <h2>Geography</h2>
                    <p>Bolonia is a coastal village and beach in the municipality of Tarifa in the Province of Cadiz in southern Spain. It is located on the Atlantic shore, 22.9 kilometres (14.2 mi) by road west of Tarifa, but is much closer in terms of coastal distance. The beach and bay is also known as Playa de Bolonia ("Bolonia Beach"), Ensenada de Bolonia ("Bolonia Cove"), or Bolonia Bay. The ruins of the Roman town of Baelo Claudia are located near the beach, considered to be the most complete Roman town ruins yet uncovered in Spain. The beach is about 3.8 kilometres (2.4 mi) in length, with an average width of about 70 metres (230 ft). In 2011 it had a population of 117 people.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolonia,_Spain">(wikipedia)</a></p>

                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>Cala Goloritze, a tiny but stunning beach at the base of a deep and pleasant ravine, is located just south of Cala Biriola, in the Ogliastra area, 9 kilometers north of Baunei.

                        Cala Goloritze beach is one of the most photogenic of its kind. It is only reachable on foot or by boat. If you’re planning on coming on foot, the hike to Cala Goloritze takes more than one hour, and the return trip will probably take you twice as long. <a href="http://www.sardinianbeaches.com/beaches-of-sardinia/east/baunei/cala-goloritze/">(Sardinian Beaches)</a><br></p>
                    <h2>Geography</h2>
                    <p>Cala Goloritzé is a beach that is located in the town of Baunei, in the southern part of the Gulf of Orosei, in Ogliastra, Sardinia.


                        Cala Goloritzé.
                        The beach, one of the most evocative of Sardinia, was created by a landslide in 1962; it is famous for its high pinnacle of 143 meters above the cove. Another feature of the beach is the natural arch that opens on the right side of the bay. The beach is composed of small white pebbles and sand.
                        
                        Goloritzé can be reached by boat, or by a path that from the Gulf reaches the cove, with a vertical drop of 470 meters and about an hour and a half walk. Currently (summer 2007) the coast near the beach (200 m from the shore) is completely closed to traffic of motorboats to preserve the beach from pollution and from the assault of tourists. To get to the beach by sea, the most comfortable and less demanding, available transport services are rental boats from the nearby ports of Arbatax and Santa Maria Navarrese (frazione of Baunei).<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cala_Goloritz%C3%A9">(Wikipedia)</a></p>

                    <p>Elafonisi (Greek: Ελαφονήσι [elafoˈnisi] "deer island") is an island located close to the southwestern corner of the Mediterranean island of Crete, of which it is administratively a part, in the regional unit of Chania. When the weather is fine it is possible to walk to the island through the shallow water. The island is a protected nature reserve. It is known for its pink sand beaches, created by tidal and wave-induced deposits of pigmented microorganisms living in a symbiotic relationship with native seaweed. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elafonisi">(wikipedia)</a><br><br> </p>
                    <h2>Geography</h2>
                    <p>Elafonissos is a tiny island on the southern side of the peninsula of Laconia, eastern Peloponnese. Only a narrow strait of sea separates it from the town of Neapoli, on the opposite coast of Peloponnese, from where the ferries to Elafonissos depart. In fact, scientists believed that the island of Elafonissos was once attached to Peloponnese but it separated due to an earthquake in the 1st century BC. This is why the history of Elafonissos is so connected to the history of Peloponnese. <a href="https://www.greeka.com/peloponnese/elafonissos/geography/">(greeka)</a></p>

                    <p>There are quite a few beaches from where you can watch dolphins on the sea. Watching these adorable creatures enjoy their natural habitat and play around is an endearing sight. To get to know them from close, you can also go swimming along with the dolphins on some beaches.

                    <p>A great way to enjoy a holiday is just by spending a lazy day relaxing and enjoying your company. What better place than a beach to do that! Lie down on the cushiony sand bed, wear your sunglasses and bask in the sunrays. Feeling the warmth of the sun while enjoying the beach scenes is quite rejuvenating. You can also read your favourite novel if you wish while sunbathing. <a href="https://www.intermiles.com/blog/10-fun-things-to-do-at-the-beach">(intermiles)</a> </p>

                     <p>Porto Katsiki (Greek: Πόρτο Κατσίκι, "goat port") is a beach on the Ionian island of Lefkada, Greece. The name is said to be because formerly only goats could reach this area.

                        The beach is famed for its landscape and clear blue sea. It is located at the bottom of a concave pale cliff. It is 35 km from Lefkada town, near Athani village. Porto Katsiki has parking lots and canteens. There is no lodging, and camping is prohibited. There is a stairway down to the beach from the cliff-top parking. In the day, boats bring tourists to the beach, particularly from nearby Nidri. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Katsiki">(wikipedia)</a><br><br> </p>

                     <p>It is one of the most beautiful creeks in Marseille but also one of the most isolated in the Calanques National Park. Being able to swim in En-Vau is a well-deserved reward because to access it, you have to hike or arrive by sea with a boat. <a href="https://www.marseilletourisme.fr/en/places-see/calanques/calanque-en-vau/">marseilletourisme</a> <br><br> </p>
                     <h2>Geography</h2>
                     <p>The best known examples of this formation can be found in the Massif des Calanques (Massís dei calancas in Occitan, the traditional local language) in the Bouches-du-Rhône department of Southern France. The range extends for 20 km (12 mi) in length and four kilometres (2.5 mi) in width along the coast between Marseille and Cassis, culminating in Mont Puget (565 m or 1,854 ft). Similar calanques can also be found on the French Riviera near the Massif de l'Esterel and on the island of Corsica (Calanques de Piana). The highest points along the calanques are located at Mont Puget (565 m or 1,854 ft) and in the mountains of Marseilleveyre (432 m or 1,417 ft).[4] Similarities are seen between calanques and rias, the river mouths formed along the coast of Brittany in Northern France.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calanque">(wikipedia)</a> </p>

                     <p>The beach has a length of three hundred meters and is characterized by a white sandy bottom, formed by the crumbling of the monzogranite , typical of that area of ​​the island; moreover, the beach is divided by smooth granite rocks. Towards the middle of the coast stands the building known as the "Arsenale", begun in 1835 by the Pisani family and later distorted by building additions, adjacent to the "Casa Zimmer", now transformed into a restaurant, which was inhabited from 1907 to 1914 by the German Zimmer family, owner of the monzogranite quarries of Cavoli and Seccheto .<a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiaggia_di_Cavoli">(wikipedia)</a><br><br> </p>
