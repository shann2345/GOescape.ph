                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>Constructed in 1889 by Gustave Eiffel, the Eiffel tower was originally meant to be temporary in Paris and no one could have ever imagined that decades later, it would literally be the most famous landmark in Europe.

                        Standing at a height of 324 meters (1,063 ft) tall, the Eiffel Tower is the tallest structure in Paris and the second in France after Millau Viaduct – the tower can be seen from many parts of the city. <a href="https://theadventurousfeet.com/famous-landmarks-in-europe/">(theadventurousfeet)</a> <br><br></p>

                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>One of the most visited Landmarks in Barcelona and Spain as a whole is La Sagrada Familia, a large Basilica whose construction started in 1883 by Antoni Gaudi. Though the construction is still not yet done even after 137 years, La Sagrada Familia is one of the famous landmarks of Europe. Due to the slow construction process of The Balisica, since all the funds come from donations, it is still unclear when the construction will be completed but there is some information that it’s likely to be finished by 2026 – a year that marks 100 years since Gaudi’s death.

                     <p>Big Ben is the largest of the tower's five bells and weighs 13.5 long tons (13.7 tonnes; 15.1 short tons).[3] It was the largest bell in the United Kingdom for 23 years. The origin of the bell's nickname is open to question; it may be named after Sir Benjamin Hall, who oversaw its installation, or heavyweight boxing champion Benjamin Caunt. Four quarter bells chime at 15, 30 and 45 minutes past the hour and just before Big Ben tolls on the hour. The clock uses its original Victorian mechanism, but an electric motor can be used as a backup. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ben">(wikipedia)</a><br></p>

                     <h2>Description</h2>
                     <p>The Brandenburg Gate is an 18th-century neoclassical monument in Berlin, built on the orders of Prussian king Frederick William II after restoring the Orangist power by suppressing the Dutch popular unrest. One of the best-known landmarks of Germany, it was built on the site of a former city gate that marked the start of the road from Berlin to the town of Brandenburg an der Havel, which used to be the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg. <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_Gate">(europeanbestdestinations)</a> <br><br> </p>
                     <h2>Geography</h2>
                     <p>It is located in the western part of the city centre of Berlin within Mitte, at the junction of Unter den Linden and Ebertstraße, immediately west of the Pariser Platz. One block to the north stands the Reichstag building, which houses the German parliament (Bundestag). The gate is the monumental entry to Unter den Linden, a boulevard of linden trees which led directly to the royal City Palace of the Prussian monarchs.<a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_Gate">(europeanbestdestinations)</a>  </p>

                     <h2>Description</h2>
                     <p>Neuschwanstein Castle is a 19th-century historicist palace on a rugged hill above the village of Hohenschwangau near Füssen in southwest Bavaria, Germany. The palace was commissioned by King Ludwig II of Bavaria as a retreat and in honour of composer Richard Wagner. Ludwig chose to pay for the palace out of his personal fortune and by means of extensive borrowing, rather than Bavarian public funds. Construction began in 1869, but was never completed.<a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuschwanstein_Castle">(wikipedia)</a><br><br> </p>
                     <h2>Geography</h2>
                     <p>The municipality of Schwangau lies at an elevation of 800 m (2,620 ft) at the southwest border of the German state of Bavaria. Its surroundings are characterised by the transition between the Alpine foothills in the south (toward the nearby Austrian border) and a hilly landscape in the north that appears flat by comparison.<a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuschwanstein_Castle">(wikipedia)</a></p>
