                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>Skógafoss is a waterfall on the Skógá River in the south of Iceland at the cliff marking the former coastline. After the coastline had receded (it is now at a distance of about 5 kilometres (3 miles) from Skógar), the former sea cliffs remained, parallel to the coast over hundreds of kilometres, creating together with some mountains a clear border between the coastal lowlands and the Highlands of Iceland.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sk%C3%B3gafoss#Geography">(wikipedia)</a><br><br></p>
                    <h2>Geography</h2>
                    <p>The Skógafoss is one of the biggest waterfalls in the country, with a width of 25 metres (82 feet) and a drop of 60 m (200 ft). Due to the amount of spray the waterfall consistently produces, a single or double rainbow is normally visible on sunny days. Visitors can be drenched if they go too near the waterfall, again due to the spray.[1] According to legend, the first Viking settler in the area, Þrasi Þórólfsson, buried a treasure in a cave behind the waterfall. The legend continues that locals found the chest years later, but were only able to grasp the ring on the side of the chest before it disappeared again. The ring was allegedly given to the local church. The old church door ring is now in the Skógar museum.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sk%C3%B3gafoss#Geography">(wikipedia)</a></p>

                     <h2>Description</h2>
                     <p>Krka National Park is one of the Croatian national parks, named after the river Krka that it encloses. It is located along the middle-lower course of the Krka River in central Dalmatia, in Šibenik-Knin county, downstream Miljevci area, and just a few kilometers northeast of the city of Šibenik. It was formed to protect the Krka River and is intended primarily for scientific, cultural, educational, recreational, and tourism activities. It is the seventh national park in Croatia and was proclaimed a national park in 1985. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sk%C3%B3gafoss">(wikipedia)</a><br><br> </p>
                     <h2>Geography</h2>
                     <p>The Krka National Park is located entirely within the territory of Šibenik-Knin County and encompasses an area of 109 square kilometers along the Krka River: two kilometers downriver from Knin to Skradin and the lower part of the river Čikola. The Krka National Park is a spacious, largely unchanged region of exceptional and multifaceted natural value, and includes one or more preserved or insignificantly altered ecosystems. The Krka Waterfalls area has the second highest density of lavender in Europe, hence the high frequency of wasps and bees in the area.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krka_National_Park">(wikipedia)</a></p>

                     <h2>Description</h2>
                     <p>The origin of the waterfall's name is not completely clear. In modern Icelandic, the name can be read either as "waterfall of the goð (pagan idols)" or "waterfall of the goði (chieftain)." Linguist and placename expert Svavar Sigmundsson suggests that the name derives from two crags at the falls which resemble pagan idols. In 1879-1882, a myth was published in Denmark according to which the waterfall was named when the lawspeaker Þorgeir Ljósvetningagoði made Christianity the official religion of Iceland in the year 999 or 1000. Upon returning home from the Alþingi, Þorgeir supposedly threw his statues of the Norse gods into the waterfall. However, although the story of Þorgeir's role in the adoption of Christianity in Iceland is preserved in Ari Þorgilsson's Íslendingabók, no mention is made of Þorgeir throwing his idols into Goðafoss. The legend appears to be a nineteenth-century fabrication. Nevertheless, a window in Akureyrarkirkja, the main church at Akureyri, illustrates this story. <br><br> </p>

                     <p>Goðafoss (Icelandic pronunciation: ​[ˈkɔːðaˌfɔsː]) is a waterfall in northern Iceland. It is located along the country's main ring road at the junction with the Sprengisandur highland road, about 45 minutes from Akureyri. The water of the river Skjálfandafljót falls from a height of 12 metres over a width of 30 metres.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go%C3%B0afoss">(wikipedia)</a> </p>

                     <p>The waterfall is made up of a 100m drop  followed by a series of multiple waterfalls that come together to form a final waterfall.
                        246 meters high, it is one of the most picturesque and imposing in the Pyrenees. Count Henry Russell , a famous 19th century Pyrenean , placed it ahead of all his  rivals.<br><br> </p>
